### To be developed

After defending an undergraduate thesis at Binghamton University on gold nanoparticles and their use in disease detection I decided that if I wanted to help shape the world around me, I needed to learn the modern tools that are used.


I attended Fullstack Academy to learn web development and have spent time since graduating becoming a better software engineer.


I am now an apprentice at 8th Light, learning how to be a professional, clean coder.


Beautiful, intuitive design, an awareness of the algorithms and data structures that have been discovered and studied by the thought leaders before me, and passion for the accelerating potential of new techonologies drive me to keep learning and growing today.
